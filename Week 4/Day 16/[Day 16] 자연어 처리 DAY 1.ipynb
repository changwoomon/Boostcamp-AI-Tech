    "### Trends of NLP\n",
    "- Text data can basically be viewed as a sequence of words, and each word can be represented as a vector through a technique such as Word2Vec or GloVe\n",
    "- RNN-family models (LSTMs and GRUs), which take the sequence of these vectors of words as input, are the main architecture of NLP tasks\n",
    "- Overall performance of NLP tasts has been improved since attention modules and Transformer models, which replaced RNNs with self-attention, have been introduced a few years ago\n",
    "- As is the case for Transformer models, most of the advanced NLP models have been originally developed for improving machine translation tasks\n",
    "- In the early days, customized models for different NLP tasks had developed separately\n",
    "- Since Transformer was introduced, huge models were released by stacking its basic module, self-attention, and these models are trained with large-size datasets through language modeling tasks, one of the self-supervised training setting that does not require additional labels for a particular task\n",
    "    - ex. BERT, GPT-3\n",
    "- Afterwards, above models were applied to other tasks through transfer learning, and they outperformed all other customized models in each task\n",
    "- Currently, these models has now become essential part in numerous NLP tasks, so NLP research become difficult with limited GPU resources, since they are too large to train"
